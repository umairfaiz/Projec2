life dream come true
also starts miss family not company security bring
furnace basement monster old man next door snow shovel murderer two crooks trying break house
cute much actor
still see character grows thanks good direction editing
example acting little emotional impact scene searches seasonal night getting car
asks man pass request wants family back real
learned deal
turn lights not scary anymore
goes church one evening sees snow shovel murderer actually turns nice man
talk learns age alone not make less afraid
finally last minutes confronts last head literally
last act full violent comedic slapstick movie genuine dramatic setup dessert
lot fun overwhelm rest movie
whole home alone great holiday movie
john original score sound feel holiday music without disadvantage overplayed malls setting put mood family gatherings
flaws
smallest problem act well
said cute repeated viewings reveal covered insight character
biggest problem coda villains life five times
might argue tone agree
mixing comedy specific viable pas
probably never see home alone wish skipped home alone enjoy home alone almost every year
let impressions others detract original much offer cartoon slapstick
premiere key west height missile crisis
hopes capitalize tense moment providing escape town
see events stories four teenagers life affects
quick easy review really enjoyed
mixture comedy tension blended nicely
unlike many comedies film tries succeeds getting past stage anything laugh
makers film also cared telling intelligent story
performances principals right mark particularly john schlock master
would definitely recommend film anyone looking light hearted yet interesting way spend couple hours
longer detailed review beware spoilers
primary reason enjoyed film comedy film also intelligent story tell
many comedies today subscribe notion comedy need make laugh
watch movie laugh lot leave take nothing
not like
left picture thinking would faced missile crisis
found wondering would happen characters film
importantly found caring would happen characters
comedy film centers around character film brings key west
believe one finest comedic actors business today
highly expressive physically vocally
felt least deserved nomination work fink
characters often lost scene due commanding nature however star actually not center film
movie really story four teenagers discovering want background minute could end
thought kids reaction highly realistic
tried block tried escape concerns world
unfortunately kept creeping back particularly fear chaos time
comedy centered drama teens great deal overlap
several aspects panic shown humorous light
one example scene people fighting last cans boxes food grocery store
think threat nuclear annihilation seems hardly backdrop comedy works
another reason like film like science fiction movies
one favorite films go watch plan outer space
note not say one favorite movies one favorite see

never got made many films like
serves mostly homage films loves
would like recommend anybody looking good humorous story
gag film like many comedies intelligent well thought film real people real problems told often hilarious way enjoy

homer dad played cooper favorite actor mine since lone star
plays antithesis character played instead organizing union rallies head coal miners constantly wringing hands unions
one great unnoticed performances year note multi dimensional character
son last nemesis one likely interferes son dreams
truly loves son wants see succeed way knows
coal mining
character see far come
revolution modern technology allowed us see society advanced rate far faster generation us

review memento sort movie wish written think no higher praise

no resolution war small large scale decades

no healing no closure level despite needless tacked ending voice narration adult framing story
earth ways exceptional movie
not reinvent wheel following instead standard pattern historical dramas

biggest slams come visits royal domicile closely resembles certain magic kingdom souvenir stands queue lines display figures sing palace rules relentlessly peppy tune sounds lot like small world
brings disturbing point number one
laughed swipes found mentality behind bit sad
acrimony honcho big wheel well known

using entire movie attack former employer
suggestion two boys grow
put past behind
room sandbox ca play nice go rooms
area found troubling came portrayal lord
beyond irreverence actually message people learn look beyond physical appearances true beauty lies within
lovely notion film betrays moral incessantly taking cheap shots diminutive stature
really need family film reinforcing idea short people acceptable
pompous selfish behavior enough make target zingers
adding short jokes simply mean
still rollicking good time

watching first ten minutes film never eat bowl way
scene old man teaching young one eat soupy bowl noodles master would teach eager apprentice
caress noodles chopsticks says put roast pork side bowl saying see soon
course meant parody earnestness underneath makes take certain degree sobriety
begin appreciate food not merely something eat not something like not something enjoy rather something experience
experiencing process engages senses fulfilling one terms weaving total pleasure sum parts
trust really want go find noodle shop point
brings sense serious parody food forefront making story follow pattern western set modern day japan
stranger comes town finds proprietor small hole wall noodle shop trying fend insults local strongman
defend honor woman noodles gets fight ringleader henchmen emerging bloodied victorious
finds ambition shop people would flock far away eat bowl
problem fare something less popular less appetizing
however agrees help quest process seek wisdom elderly noodle expert enlist aid wealthy patron make friends former enemy
film filled many little scenes absolute gems
take example tries buy recipe delicious soup another shop owner
price high owner store next door secretly sell affordable sum
meets store late night leads back room
protests thinking perhaps man ulterior motives insists
bolt exit shows small gap wall adjoining store noodle shop next door
peers takes notes watches cook make soup next day face filled joy felt audience
scene comical effective filling viewer sense trepidation relief discovery
also interesting scene introduces son bunch street people despite economic trappings gourmets master sommeliers
even watch one sneaks kitchen restaurant expertly prepares omelet
scene meant bring laugh also says no matter whether people rich poor food something everyone common enjoyment food experience shared
also number unrelated vignettes appearing throughout film help illustrate accentuate role food people lives
particularly effective one involves wife mother tended home doctor
surrounded children obviously last hours life
husband comes home seeing condition demands get make dinner
viewer knows husband intention not mean desperate normalcy family obviously deprived wife making dinner essential part
near miracle wife drags kitchen prepares quick meal brings awaiting family
family eats looks smiles
preparing food family joy comfort brief moment enjoys normalcy
falls dead
moment family stunned father yells children keep eating
last meal mother ever made
crying family finishes meal
scene comical awkward moving beautiful
including vignettes ran risk creating disjointed film surprisingly not interrupt pacing main storyline
instead even help contribute idea goal able serve exceptional food worthy even noble
film parodies western construction plot fairly predictable still enjoyable watch familiar way good guys come together final showdown
case showdown
eat soup knows succeeded
pretty obvious outcome film changes whole perspective something consume every day life afford cut little slack
old saying states something leaving best last
certainly followed adage crafting original star wars trilogy
return final installment series easily innovative action packed entertaining three films
dark eerie atmosphere oozed every frame empire strikes back gone
instead return good triumphing decisively resolution love triangle walking teddy bears
even seem intimidating time around
arrival emperor apparition like creature played turned somewhat henchman
return picks unspecified time conclusion empire strikes back
princess rescue mission home planet
goal save solo clutches intergalactic gangster
home creepy looking stone fortress guarded hog nosed beasts added special effects come play
hysterical scene involving music group dreaded beast outside sand barge effects top notch
soon freed freeze rescued clutches back outer space rebel alliance face empire newest second powerful star activated could spell anyone stands emperor
fleet prepares final company travel forest moon knock shield defends star
befriended teddy bear like native race fearing presence endangering group turns
return interesting elements
scenes pitted emperor suitably tense well acted
technical point view space battles amazing easily hindering anything depicted previous films
many many ships speed range movement dramatically improved
one level return almost worth watching special effects
special edition even ships added making final space battle incredibly fun watch
acting return stronger previous films
mark ford fisher matured screen
chemistry amongst trio
empire billy gives us another human hero root
newcomer plays emperor suitably creature although not imposing star wars
although great fun watching star wars empire strikes back big screen return generates greater sense enjoyment
spectacular new special effects adorable emperor old falcon incredible new star always lovable return concludes one greatest trilogies ever made huge bang

iron giant directed co written brad bird late animated series king hill assumes not children handle discussions entertained time

soon becomes apparent dean ca keep giant secret forever government spook named brought investigate sightings surrounding forest area considers giant threat national security
suspects knows something giant takes residence house lodger
meanwhile giant begins exhibit ominous behavior suggests built weapon kind
iron giant exactly family films ought talk audience
story simple simple alien drops sky befriends young boy
similar classic comparisons actually deserved case iron giant
film holds many better elements film ability sentimental without turning sappy
film delivers several serious messages important one ability choose one fate
teaches giant go programming become wants hero
final sequence touching appropriate though give away say beautiful
animation not standard good enough make forget watching cartoon
giant computer animated human characters hand drawn old fashioned way
characters faces done quite well drawn realistically enough make personalities credible features exaggerated allow expressions provide comic relief
fine voice work turned young surprisingly convincing waitress mother
harry nice characterization dean really enjoyed voice work john army general called agent
unlike several cartoon features character actually developed personality rather stereotype actually integral plot rather superfluous comic relief sidekick
dean example could stereotypical beatnik character profile seems suggest presented character real emotions thoughts motivations
even heavy agent not villain things simply wants fear paranoia
lesser animated feature would drawn paper thin stereotypes figure kids mind iron giant clearly put little work making characters real pays
film around deliver heavy handed messages though
also funny humor kind children adults enjoy
scenes teaches giant certain things dive pool handled well director brad bird clearly sense comic timing worked many years
sequence attempt outlast one another trying stay awake nicely timed also extremely clever
film even takes jabs nuclear paranoia early stages cold war satirizing lame safety films shown grade school students tell duck cover event nuclear attack
iron giant much satirical edge family films edgy humor actually quite refreshing
instead seeing people get head get well timed clever gags seem required imagination come
get right iron giant no story boy robot
story straightforward quaint ultimately becomes charming
though enjoy complex plotting film much next person comes family entertainment simple way go
akin one bedtime stories father told hanging every word not story sets film others kind rather elements go story namely real characters thoughtful iron giant spades
